# STM32f407-DISC-Temperature-Sensor-Inbuilt

This program gets the temperature values from the on board temperature sensor of the STM32f407 DISC, using the ADC1 peripheral.

(Note: The temperature values from the on board sensor signify the temperature of the board, and hence are greater than the actual ambient temperature.)
